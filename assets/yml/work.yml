  details:
    - Developed an autonomous navigation system using reinforcement learning, leveraging ROS, and Gazebo.
    - Built multiple chatbots for sentiment analysis, question-answering, and text summarization using Hugging Face Transformers, fine-tuning pretrained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, deployed via a userfriendly Streamlit interface.
    - Developed specialized dashboards for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), leveraging BigQuery, Tableau, and Python to empower Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in monitoring and addressing system deviations effectively.
    - Designed a navigation page in Tableau Online to streamline access to multiple dashboards, enhancing user experience, and efficiency.
    - Developed multiple machine learning models for MHEV (Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle) DC-DC fault prediction, leveraging one-class SVM, and various binary classification techniques. The models were designed to predict potential DC-DC converter failures, a crucial component in electric and hybrid vehicles, by analyzing operational data and identifying early signs of failure.
